# Distant Spaces


:Use DNA Spaces and Cisco Webex Teams to help with social distancing in workplace enviroments.

## Business/Technical Challenge


As the rise of social distancing practices comes to professional workplace environments, employees are becoming more aware of proper practices that will reduce the spread of COVID19. In particular, certain areas in the office such as cafeterias were often used with no regard to social distancing rules.

## Proposed Solution


As such, Distant Spaces is a solution that tackles this issue by connecting to the office wireless system, based on catalyst 9k or Meraki APs, tow webex teams bot to allow employees to query the bot before entering an area to check if it's safe to enter or not. This will require mapping of the office floor and devices to be connected to the corporate network. For example, before entering the floor where the cafeteria is located, an employee can query the bot and retrieve the following information: 

- Status of the floor (Safe, busy, very busy) based on client count
- Sanitization station location (masks, hand sanitizer)
- Office Admin contact info/ start a conversation
